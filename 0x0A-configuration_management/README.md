Automation plays an essential role in server configuration management. It’s the mechanism used to make the server reach a desirable state, previously defined by provisioning scripts using a tool’s specific language and features. Automation is, in fact, the heart of configuration management for servers, and that’s why it’s common to also refer to configuration management tools as Automation Tools or IT Automation Tools.

I would embark on the process of automating server provisioning using Puppet, a popular configuration management tool capable of managing complex infrastructure in a transparent way, using a master server to orchestrate the configuration of the nodes.
